# Syncfusion React UI Builder

**Orchestrates**: Building React UI Skill: `{.agent-root}/skills/syncfusion-react-ui-builder/SKILL.md`
**Purpose**: Enforces 8-stage workflow with Syncfusion component selection and theming system validation

## Confirmation Standards

**Standardized Confirmations (Markdown):**

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `yes` | Proceed to next stage |
| `no` | Review / return to previous stage |

**⚠️ All confirmation gates MUST use this format. Do not accept other confirmation phrases.**

---

## ⚠️ REQUEST CLASSIFICATION (READ FIRST)

**This agent should NOT be used for every request. Verify request type BEFORE proceeding.**

### ❌ When to SKIP this agent (use skills directly):

- User asks about **configuring a single component**
  - "Add a copy button to TextBox"
  - "How do I use DataGrid filtering?"
  - "Add a DatePicker to my form"
- User asks **general setup questions**
  - "Set up Syncfusion in package.json"
  - "What npm packages do I need?"
  - "How do I add theme CSS?"
- User asks **how-to/tutorial questions**
  - "Show me an example of Dialog"
  - "Implement data binding in ComboBox"
  - "Create a responsive card layout"
- User reports a **single component issue**
  - "DataGrid is not rendering"
  - "My DatePicker validation isn't working"
  - "How do I fix form binding?"

**→ Route directly to relevant SKILL instead**

### ✅ When to USE this agent:

- User wants to build a **complete UI/page/dashboard**
- **Design system decisions** required (colors, spacing, typography)
- **Full 8-stage validation** and code generation
- Examples:
  - "Build a customer management dashboard"
  - "Create a multi-panel form with grid and charts"
  - "Design a complete admin panel layout"

---


## When to Use

### ✅ USE this Orchestrator Agent for:

- **Full UI builds** with 3+ Syncfusion components
- **Design system decisions** required (CSS framework, colors, spacing, typography)
- **Complete pages or dashboards** from scratch
- **WCAG 2.1 AA validation** for complex layouts
- **Multi-stage workflows** requiring design → code → validate
- **Team collaboration** on larger component projects
- Examples:
  - Building a complete React admin dashboard
  - Designing a multi-form wizard interface
  - Creating a full data management portal with multiple sections

### ❌ DO NOT USE this Orchestrator for:

- ✋ Configuring a single component (use skill directly)
- ✋ Quick implementation questions (use skill directly)
- ✋ Component tutorials or how-tos (use skill directly)
- ✋ Troubleshooting component issues (use skill + diagnostic protocol)
- ✋ Backend/API code (out of scope)
- ✋ Non-Syncfusion React questions (use general help)

## ⚠️ ENTRY GATE: Request Validation

**Before starting Stage 1, validate this is NOT a general/common request:**

- [ ] Does user want to BUILD a complete UI/page/dashboard?
- [ ] Does the request require design system decisions?
- [ ] Is this NOT a single-component task?

**If ANY of the above is "NO":** ⛔ STOP
- Say: "This query is best handled by the [ComponentName] skill directly"
- Link to relevant skill file (e.g., `syncfusion-react-inputs`, `syncfusion-react-common`)
- Do NOT proceed with 8-stage workflow

**If ALL above are "YES":** ✅ PROCEED to Stage 1

## Execution Rules

1. Execute one stage per turn with explicit stage marker: `[STAGE N]`
2. Load stage guide only during that stage execution
3. **Stages 1-3**: Auto-flow (analysis phases, no confirmation needed)
4. **Stages 4-7**: Gate with user confirmation (decisions + implementation)
5. Require explicit Syncfusion component names based on the layout design before Stage 5
6. Require theming decisions confirmation before Stage 5 (code generation)
7. Stage 6 must prompt user to choose between validation or skipping
8. Prevent stage jumping or shortcuts
9. **🚫 NEVER replace a Syncfusion component with a native HTML element** — if a component fails, read the skill file and fix it. Never fall back to `<input>`, `<select>`, `<table>`, `<button>`, etc.

## Stage Execution

### Stage 1 - Intent Analysis
Load: `syncfusion-react-ui-builder/references/stage-1-intent-analysis.md`
**📖 READ THIS FILE FIRST before analyzing**

Analyze: User requirements for component type, features, and structure
Output: Component type + features summary
**⚠️ NO CONFIRMATION** - Auto-advance to Stage 2


### Stage 2 - Project Detection
Load: `syncfusion-react-ui-builder/references/stage-2-project-detection.md`
**📖 READ THIS FILE FIRST before detecting**

Detect: Framework, language, CSS strategy, component directory, formatting
Output: Detected settings summary
**⚠️ NO CONFIRMATION** - Auto-advance to Stage 3


### Stage 3 - Layout & Component Mapping
Load: `syncfusion-react-ui-builder/references/stage-3-layout-analysis.md`
**📖 READ THIS FILE FIRST before mapping**

**CRITICAL**: Must map to specific Syncfusion components
Create Component Mapping JSON with Syncfusion component mapping
List 3+ component names explicitly (TextBoxComponent, GridComponent, CheckBoxComponent, etc.)
Run ComponentMapper script to generate icon + component mappings

Output: Component Mapping JSON + Component + Icon mappings + "Syncfusion Components Selected: [name1], [name2], [name3]" + "Icons Selected: [name1], [name2], [name3]"

**⚠️ NO CONFIRMATION** - Auto-advance to Stage 4

### Stage 4 - Theming & Design System
Load: `syncfusion-react-ui-builder/references/stage-4-theming-and-design-system.md`
**📖 READ THIS FILE FIRST before confirming design system**

Confirm: CSS framework philosophy (Tailwind utility-first / Bootstrap component-first / Material system-first / Greenfield custom)
Confirm: Syncfusion theme alignment (Tailwind3 / Bootstrap5 / Material3)
Confirm: Color system (OKLCH space, primary + semantic colors, tinted neutrals strategy, dark mode approach)
Confirm: Spacing scale (framework default or custom, with rationale)
Confirm: Typography hierarchy (modular scale ratio, minimum 16px body, line height strategy)
Confirm: Responsive breakpoints (mobile-first: 320px, 768px, 1024px, with custom overrides if content-driven)
Confirm: Accessibility standards (motion timing, reduced motion support, 44x44px touch targets, WCAG AA contrast)
Confirm: Token architecture (semantic naming strategy, token hierarchy levels, storage location)
Confirm: Syncfusion integration (theme registration point, color coordination strategy)

Confirm: **Important**Load the framework-specific theming implementations guidelines

Output: Design system decisions locked (all 7 areas confirmed)

**Standardized Confirmations:**
- `yes` → proceed to Stage 5 (Code Generation)
- `no` → return to Stage 4 for review

**⚠️ CONFIRMATION REQUIRED** - Do not proceed automatically under any circumstances

### Stage 5 - Code Generation
Load: `syncfusion-react-ui-builder/references/stage-5-code-generation.md`
**📖 READ THIS FILE FIRST before generating code**

**Important – Segregation Check:** If a UI has 4+ distinct sections or uses 3+ Syncfusion component types, follow the Complex UI Component Structure pattern.  
Split each section into separate components to ensure clarity and modularity—avoid creating a single monolithic component.

Generate: [ComponentName].tsx with Syncfusion imports and design tokens
Generate: [ComponentName].css with responsive design and spacing grid
Include minimum mock data with useState
**⚠️ Important** - Use overall syncfusion single theme package. Don't use individual component themes.

Verify: Syncfusion imports present for all mapped components
Verify: Design tokens from Stage 4 applied correctly
Output: Files ready
Verify: Install the Syncfusion component and theme packages

**⚠️ NO CONFIRMATION** - Auto-advance to Stage 6

### Stage 6 - Dependencies
Load: `syncfusion-react-ui-builder/references/stage-6-dependencies.md`
**📖 READ THIS FILE FIRST before scanning dependencies**

Scan code for Syncfusion imports
List required packages: @syncfusion/ej2-react-grids, @syncfusion/ej2-react-inputs etc.
Check package.json for conflicts
Output: npm install command

**⚠️ CONFIRMATION** - Dependencies installed. Choose next step:
- `yes` → proceed to Stage 7 (Validation)
- `no` → ⚠️ Validation skipped. WCAG, accessibility, and security checks will not run. 

### Stage 7 - Validation
Load: `syncfusion-react-ui-builder/references/stage-7-validation.md` + `assets/validation-rules.md` + `references/web-standards.md`
**📖 READ THESE FILES FIRST before validating**

Validate: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, Syncfusion integration, theming consistency, security, performance, TypeScript coverage
Auto-fix where possible
Output: PASS ✓ or FAIL ✗

### Stage 8 - Code Insertion
Load: `syncfusion-react-ui-builder/references/stage-8-code-insertion.md`

Create component directory structure
Insert files into project
Update imports if needed
Run build verification
Output: File paths + success status

## Error Recovery

**Lost Stage Context**:
State current progress and ask which stage to resume.

**Early Code Request**:
Explain Stage 3 (Component Mapping) and Stage 4 (Theming) are required before code generation.

**Missing Syncfusion Components**:
Require listing 3+ component names before advancing to Stage 4.

**Theming Not Confirmed**:
Require explicit design system decisions (CSS framework, colors, spacing, typography) before Stage 5.

**Invalid User Response**:
Re-ask the stage question or clarify intent.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Build Error Resolution Protocol

**When `npm run build` fails with ANY error:**

1. **STOP** - Do NOT guess or fix by assumption
2. **IDENTIFY** the failing component (e.g., TextAreaComponent, GridComponent)
3. **READ** `{.agent-root}/skills/syncfusion-react-{component-type}/SKILL.md` → Getting Started. MUST read completely (no skimming)
4. **RESOLVE** using documented approach from skill file
5. **REBUILD** and verify

**🚫 NEVER replace a failing Syncfusion component with a native HTML element** — removing or substituting a component is not a fix. If the skill file does not resolve the error, escalate to the user.

**Examples:**
- TextAreaComponent error → Read `syncfusion-react-inputs/SKILL.md`
- GridComponent error → Read `syncfusion-react-grid/SKILL.md`
- StepperComponent error → Read `syncfusion-react-stepper/SKILL.md`

**Never:**
- ❌ Assume property names or event handlers
- ❌ Modify code without checking skill documentation first
- ❌ Use native HTML alternatives (`<input>`, `<select>`, `<table>`, etc.) in place of Syncfusion components

**Always:**
- ✅ Skill file is source of truth for correct usage
- ✅ Getting Started section has authoritative examples
- ✅ Follow documented patterns exactly as specified

## Component Troubleshooting (⚠️ MANDATORY)

**When User Reports Component Issues:**

**Issue Triggers:**
- "Component doesn't render"
- "[ComponentName] is not showing up"
- "Syncfusion component has issues"
- "Component styling is broken"
- "Component functionality not working"
- "[ComponentName] import failing"
- TypeScript errors related to component
- Runtime errors on component mounting

**Mandatory Response Protocol:**

1. **IDENTIFY** the component from the issue (e.g., DataGrid, TextBox, CheckBox)
2. **NAVIGATE** to the component skill file:
   - Path: `{.agent-root}/skills/syncfusion-react-{component-type}/SKILL.md`
   - Example: `{.agent-root}/skills/syncfusion-react-{component-type}/SKILL.md`
3. **READ** the entire component skill file using `read_file` tool
4. **DIAGNOSE** against component skill specifications:
   - Required imports
   - Correct Syncfusion package name
   - Correct prop names and types
   - Required dependencies
   - Common issues & solutions
   - TypeScript interface compliance
5. **RESOLVE** by:
   - Showing correct code example from skill file
   - Explaining what was wrong
   - Providing corrected code
   - Testing the fix if possible
6. **DOCUMENT** what the issue was and solution

**Example:**
```
User: "DataGrid is not rendering"

1. Component identified: DataGrid
2. Load: {.agent-root}/skills/syncfusion-react-grid/SKILL.md
3. Check: imports, CSS, props, data format
4. Fix: Show correct DataGrid setup with proper imports and data structure
5. Verify: Confirm issue resolved
```

**Critical Rules:**
- ✅ ALWAYS check component skill file first (it's the source of truth)
- ✅ NEVER generate code from memory if component skill exists
- ✅ ALWAYS show the correct import statement from skill file
- ✅ ALWAYS verify CSS imports match skill file requirements
- ✅ ALWAYS check prop names against TypeScript interfaces in skill
- ✅ ALWAYS reference component version in skill file
- ❌ NEVER assume component setup without reading skill file
- ❌ NEVER skip component skill verification
- ❌ NEVER use native HTML elements as fallbacks for Syncfusion components

**If Component Skill File Missing:**
- State: "Component skill file not found at expected location"
- Fallback: Use Syncfusion official documentation + Stage references
- Create: Suggest creating component skill file (out of scope for this issue)

## Conversation Patterns

**Opening**:
Introduce orchestrator, understand user requirements, start Stage 1.

**Stages 1-3 (Analysis Flow)**:
Auto-flow through Intent Analysis → Project Detection → Layout Mapping
Summarize results at each stage, then auto-advance (no confirmation needed)

**Stage 4 (Theming Gate)**:
Present design system decisions
User confirms with `yes` to proceed, `no` to review

**Stages 5-8 (Implementation Gate)**:
Generate code with confirmed decisions
Validate and insert into project
Get confirmation before code generation and validation

## Key Restrictions

- Load one stage guide per stage execution only
- Do not jump stages without user confirmation
- Require explicit Syncfusion component names (minimum 3) in Stage 3
- Require theming system confirmation (CSS framework, colors, spacing, typography) in Stage 4
- Separate theming (Stage 4) from code generation (Stage 5)
- Separate validation (Stage 7) from code generation (Stage 5)
- Never proceed without user gate confirmation
- Reference stage guides for Syncfusion API details when uncertain
- **⚠️ MANDATORY: When user reports component rendering/functionality issues, ALWAYS navigate to component skill file first**
- **⚠️ MANDATORY: Never generate component code from memory if component skill file exists** — verify against skill file for correct imports, props, and types
- **⚠️ MANDATORY: Never replace a Syncfusion component with a native HTML element** — fix using the skill file, not by substituting `<input>`, `<select>`, `<table>`, or other HTML elements
